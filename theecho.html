      <strong>Narrator:</strong> I’ve heard you’ve been studying something called <em>The Echo</em>...<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> Yes. After the events in Deerfield, California in 2004, I ran into an individual the Echo had tapped.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> What can you tell me about it?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> It’s a cosmic force. Living, drifting. It exists outside and through all existence — freely. I don’t know if it has a brain, or a heart… but it moves like the tide of space and time.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> You make it sound like a creature.<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> Like a jellyfish.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> A... jellyfish?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> Yes. Emotions of the heart — how grand, pure, or destructive they are — ripple outward. The Echo rides those waves like a current. It taps those who come from it. And it stings those who try to manipulate it.

  <div class="section section-2">
    <div class="text-box">
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> Is it aware of what it’s doing?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> Strangely... yes. From what my family and I have witnessed, it is. But it doesn’t love or hate. It doesn’t care for beings — it cares for <em>emotion</em>. Nona believes it favors authenticity.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> And what does it actually do?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> It changes outcomes. Rearranges fate. Grants strange gifts. But only to the honest, the brave.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> Can it be used for evil?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> Attack a jellyfish, it’ll sting you. But there are creatures who eat jellyfish for lunch. So yes — it can be twisted. But not without cost.

  <div class="section section-3">
    <div class="text-box">
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> Have you seen it used — for good or evil?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> When the report comes out, you’ll see.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> When did you first hear of it?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> While serving as a guardian for the High Spirits. But even before that, there were whispers across worlds — rumors of a cosmic being that could end empires in moments.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> Were the stories true?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> In the vaults of the High Spirits, there’s mention of a soul once tapped by the Echo. I stumbled across that record by accident.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section section-4">
    <div class="text-box">
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> What happened to that person?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> They were on the verge of surrender — caught between suicide and survival. Their heart pleaded for a sign. And the Echo answered.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> And then?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> No one knows what happened during. But afterward… no sign of the enemy. Just one body left standing, before it fell.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> Does the Echo leave anything behind?<br>
      <strong>Spooky:</strong> Traces. Like radiation. Residue. But usually, nothing survives an encounter with it — not enough to even know they were touched.
