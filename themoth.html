      <em>Narrator:</em> So let's talk about your daughter<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> Star? My little moth. First of her kind.<br>

      <em>Narrator:</em> What do you mean by all that?<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> She's half ragdoll, half fae, and all mischief. She can change into moths at will, let's not even get into her little pure white light form..<br><br>

      <em>Narrator:</em> What's she like?<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em>  She’s curious, fearless, and has a knack for getting into trouble. But she’s also fiercely loyal and has a heart of gold.<br><br>
       <em>Narrator:</em> What was raising her like?<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> Imagine a dance between shadows and light, where every step is a whisper and every twirl is a secret.<br><br>

      <em>Narrator:</em> I'm a bit perplexed. She looks almost as young as you<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> I know, it's weird. But when you live between existence, time changes in ways you wouldn't expect. You tend to age weirdly. She looks like she's in her late teens but I assure you, she's older than you think.

  <div class="section section-2">
    <div class="text-box">
      <em>Narrator:</em> So, what's Stars story?<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> She's a unique blend of her heritage. Born from the remnants of dreams and the whispers of the night, she embodies the essence of both worlds.<br>
      <em>Narrator:</em> Sounds like it must have been a challenge to raise her.<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> It was. But it was also a joy. She taught me as much as I taught her. We learned to navigate the shadows together, finding light in the darkest corners.<br><br>
      <em>Narrator:</em> What was the hardest part?<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> Letting her go. Knowing she had to find her own way, even if it meant stepping into the unknown.
      <em>Narrator:</em> I can only imagine. But you’ve given her the tools to navigate it, right?<br>
      <em>Spooky:</em> I hope so. I’ve given her my love, my stories, and the strength to face whatever comes her way. She’s ready to carve her own path, even if it’s a winding one.

    <div class="text-box">
      <em>Star:</em> I think I can take over it from here, dad.<br>
      <em>Narrator:</em> Star, you’re here!<br>
      <em>Star:</em> Yes, I am. I’ve been listening to your stories, and I want to share my own.<br>
        <em>Narrator:</em> Please do.<br>
        <em>Star:</em> My father has always been my guiding light, but I’ve had to find my own way in the shadows. I’ve learned to embrace my dual nature, to dance between worlds.<br>
        <em>Narrator:</em> What’s it like being half fae and half ragdoll?<br>
        <em>Star:</em> It’s a unique experience. I can see the world through both lenses, feeling the magic of the fae and the resilience of the ragdoll. It’s like having a foot in two worlds, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.<br>

  <div class="section section-4">
    <div class="text-box">
      <em>Narrator:</em> So, Star, what’s next for you?<br>
      <em>Star:</em> I want to explore the world, to understand my place in it. There’s so much to learn and experience.
        <em>Narrator:</em> And your father?<br>
        <em>Star:</em> He’ll always be with me, in spirit. I carry his stories, his love, and the lessons he taught me. I’m ready to carve my own path, even if it’s a winding one.
        <em>Narrator:</em> You’re ready to face whatever comes your way?<br>
        <em>Star:</em> I am. I’ve learned from the best. I’m ready to embrace the shadows and find the light within them.
