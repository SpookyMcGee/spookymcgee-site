    <em>Narrator:</em> So… who are you, really?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> I’ve had names, sure. But the one that stuck was Spooky McGee.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> And before that?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> My wife owns that one now. It was a wedding gift. She keeps it in a stitched little box with all the other things she’s rescued.<br>
    <br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> Then who gave you *this* name?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> A boy. He caught me stepping through his bathroom mirror — poor kid was just brushing his teeth.<br>
    Called me spooky, screamed, dropped his toothbrush. I didn’t correct him. Didn’t stay long, either.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> So you just kept it?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> I liked how it felt. Light, silly, strange. A name that didn’t take itself too seriously.<br>
    Besides, it went well with the suit. And the hat. I’ve always liked a little style in my step.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> How long ago was that?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Hard to say. The mirror didn’t show dates — just echoes. And I’ve walked through a lot of echoes since then.

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <div class="section section-2">
  <div class="text-box">
  <em> Narrator</em> Where do you come from?<br>
  <strong>Spooky:</strong> I'm a ragdoll that comes from a place between imagination and existence.<br>
  <em>Narrator:</em> What does that mean?<br>
  <strong>Spooky:</strong> Simple really. I was an abandoned ragdoll left behind in the woods. If I recall correctly, a bird carrying souls was soaring overhead. And a soul fell out of it's beak, and landed on me.<br>
  <em>Narrator:</em> So you were born from a soul?<br>
  <strong>Spooky:</strong> In a way, yes. But it’s more like I was *made* from a soul. Like a patchwork quilt, stitched together from bits of dreams and memories.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> But you look human?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> I do, but I’m not. I’m a ragdoll with a soul. I had to will this body after seeing the dangers of being easily unraveled in a wild world.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> How long ago was that? You look like you're in your mid to late 20's<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Time is a tricky thing for someone like me. I’ve seen centuries pass in the blink of an eye, yet I feel every moment like it’s a thread in my fabric.

<!-- Section 3 -->
 <div class="section section-3">
  <div class="text-box">
    <em>Narrator:</em> Have you ever left home?<br><br>

<strong>Spooky:</strong> Once. Maybe more. But the first time... it was a carnival on the coast.  
White sand, grass growing sideways into the beach. A lighthouse standing crooked behind it all like it was holding its breath.<br><br>

I lived inside that lighthouse. Survived, really. The ringmaster who ran the place — cruel man. Treated us like we were props, not people.  
I wasn't much back then. Just naive, yet adventure lived in my heart. But I knew wrong when I saw it.<br><br>

One night, I stood up to him. Broke the spell. Broke *him*. Took his top hat after. Not out of pride — but to remember the kind of man I’d never become.<br><br>

The suit? That was part of the job. All performers wore one. But I liked how it felt — neat, sharp, put-together.  
When your soul’s barely holding, sometimes a well-pressed coat is the only thing keeping you from unraveling.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> Is that where your story started?<br><br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> It’s where I *chose* to become a story.  From there, I got swept into a mercenary band. Run by Evalyn Stockdale — sharp as glass, fast as myth.  
    She wore flame-red coats and didn’t believe in rest. I followed her into wars I didn’t understand, just to be near the heat.<br>

     She was my first heartbreak. Not because she left… but because she didn’t look back.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> What came after that?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> After Nona sewed my heart back in? For a while, I served the High Spirits. A stitched outsider guarding royalty — Sara, Damien, all of them.  
    They never said I belonged, but they trusted me with what mattered.<br>

     Eventually, I left. Not out of anger. Just… when you’ve stood between gods and ghosts long enough,  
    you start wanting something smaller. A shop. A child. A little quiet.  
    So I went freelance. Still do, in a way.

<!-- Section 4 -->
 <div class="section section-4">
  <div class="text-box">
    <em>Narrator:</em> Stitched your heart?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Yes. After Evalyn, I was a mess. Heart torn out, soul frayed.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> And Nona?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Yeah. Nona worked her magic, and suddenly I felt whole again. It was like being given a second chance — not just to exist, but to *live*.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> Did that change you?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> It did. I learned to love again, to trust. Nona taught me that even the most broken things can be stitched back together.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> And your child together?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Our child? Oh, that’s a story for another time. But let’s just say, they’re a stitch of both our souls —
