  <!-- Section 1 -->
<div class="section section-1">
  <div class="text-box">
    <em>Narrator:</em> So… who are you, really?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> I’ve had names, sure. But the one that stuck was Spooky McGee.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> And before that?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> My wife owns that one now. It was a wedding gift. She keeps it in a stitched little box with all the other things she’s rescued.<br>
    Says I can borrow it if I ever remember who I was before I met her.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> Then who gave you *this* name?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> A boy. He caught me stepping through his bathroom mirror — poor kid was just brushing his teeth.<br>
    Called me spooky, screamed, dropped his toothbrush. I didn’t correct him. Didn’t stay long, either.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> So you just kept it?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> I liked how it felt. Light, silly, strange. A name that didn’t take itself too seriously.<br>
    Besides, it went well with the suit. And the hat. I’ve always liked a little style in my step.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> How long ago was that?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Hard to say. The mirror didn’t show dates — just echoes. And I’ve walked through a lot of echoes since then.
  </div>
</div>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <div class="section section-2">
  <div class="text-box">
    <em>Narrator:</em> Where did you come from?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> That’s a long walk backward, but alright.<br><br>

    <strong>Spooky:</strong> I’m what they call a ragdoll. There are different kinds — button-eyed, wire-framed, bone-built. Me? I was the stitched sort.<br><br>
    I was made at the edge of Imagination and Existence. Sewn for a child who forgot me too fast.  
    Left in the woods like a dream that didn’t stick.<br><br>
    One day, a giant black bird flew overhead. Raven, maybe. Or something older.  
    It dropped a soul it was carrying — and that soul landed on me.<br><br>
    I blinked. First breath, first fear. And not long after, I willed myself into something *safer*. Something that could walk and speak and wear a hat.<br><br>
    I still keep a home there. Little place tucked between birch trees and fog. Magical attic. Talking pallas cat. Smells like cinnamon and thunder.

<!-- Section 3 -->
 <div class="section section-3">
  <div class="text-box">
    <em>Narrator:</em> Have you ever left home?<br><br>

<strong>Spooky:</strong> Once. Maybe more. But the first time... it was a carnival on the coast.  
White sand, grass growing sideways into the beach. A lighthouse standing crooked behind it all like it was holding its breath.<br><br>

I lived inside that lighthouse. Survived, really. The ringmaster who ran the place — cruel man. Treated us like we were props, not people.  
I wasn't much back then. Just naive, yet adventure lived in my heart. But I knew wrong when I saw it.<br><br>

One night, I stood up to him. Broke the spell. Broke *him*. Took his top hat after. Not out of pride — but to remember the kind of man I’d never become.<br><br>

The suit? That was part of the job. All performers wore one. But I liked how it felt — neat, sharp, put-together.  
When your soul’s barely holding, sometimes a well-pressed coat is the only thing keeping you from unraveling.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> Is that where your story started?<br><br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> It’s where I *chose* to become a story.  From there, I got swept into a mercenary band. Run by Evalyn Stockdale — sharp as glass, fast as myth.  
    She wore flame-red coats and didn’t believe in rest. I followed her into wars I didn’t understand, just to be near the heat.<br>

     She was my first heartbreak. Not because she left… but because she didn’t look back.<br><br>

    <em>Narrator:</em> What came after that?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> After Nona sewed my heart back in? For a while, I served the High Spirits. A stitched outsider guarding royalty — Sara, Damien, all of them.  
    They never said I belonged, but they trusted me with what mattered.<br>

     Eventually, I left. Not out of anger. Just… when you’ve stood between gods and ghosts long enough,  
    you start wanting something smaller. A shop. A child. A little quiet.  
    So I went freelance. Still do, in a way.

<!-- Section 4 -->
 <div class="section section-4">
  <div class="text-box">
    <em>Narrator:</em> Stitched your heart?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Yes. After Evalyn, I was a mess. Heart torn out, soul frayed.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> And Nona?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Yeah. Nona worked her magic, and suddenly I felt whole again. It was like being given a second chance — not just to exist, but to *live*.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> Did that change you?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> It did. I learned to love again, to trust. Nona taught me that even the most broken things can be stitched back together.<br>
    <em>Narrator:</em> And your child together?<br>
    <strong>Spooky:</strong> Our child? Oh, that’s a story for another time. But let’s just say, they’re a stitch of both our souls —
