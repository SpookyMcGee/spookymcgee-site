      <strong>Narrator:</strong> So tell me, who are you exactly?<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> I’m Nona. A fae. From the Rancid Pedal Clan — mischief makers, mostly. We’ve got a thing for fast music and louder hearts. I grew up under the sound of heavy guitars and glowing trees. We called our home The Green Halo Park.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> And Spooky?<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> I guess there's a thing about stitched souls and fae hearts. Spooky McGee, my husband. He’s like a raven, a stitched soul, and a bit of a legend in his own right. We met again in the park, under the glow of carnival lights. I was drawn to him like a moth to flame — or maybe he was drawn to me.

      <strong>Narrator:</strong> You mentioned your home — The Green Halo Park?<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> It’s an existence between existences. A hidden breath between dreams and waking. Carnival lights, eternal fairgrounds, market tents you could get lost in forever. Treehouses, moss bridges, hammock cities. You slept where you landed — sometimes in rafters, sometimes in a pocket of stars.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> You raised your family there?<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> For a time, yes. It was home — until it wasn’t. I still see the place in my dreams. The way the trees glowed at night, the laughter of children echoing through the air, the smell of sweet treats and adventure.

  <div class="section section-3">
    <div class="text-box">
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> I heard you saved Spooky's life once<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> I did. Found him with his heart ripped out, threads dangling, blood like red string. He didn’t ask for help — but I knew he didn’t want to go. So I stitched it back in. Sat with him ‘til the color returned to his thread. Years passed. We crossed paths again. And this time, we didn’t walk away. <br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> How does one survive that?! <br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> Ragdolls can live through a lot of pain before death. But there he was at the edge, and I was just wondering through. In the end I think we saved each other more than we realized.

    <div class="text-box">
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> And now, a child between you. What’s that like?<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> Star? She’s... magic. Half fae, half stitched soul. She turned into moths once as a toddler and floated into the rafters — scared the lanterns out of me.<br>
      <strong>Narrator:</strong> And raising her between worlds?<br>
      <strong>Nona:</strong> It’s been an adventure. Living between Imagination and Existence, bouncing between realms and memories. But wherever she lands... she brings the light with her.
