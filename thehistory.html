      <em>Squeek Toy Destiny</em><br><br>
      My name is Sean Netherlain (<a href="https://seangriffincreates.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seangriffincreates.com</a>), I am the creator of the character ‘Spooky McGee’.<br><br>

      All of this began in the summer of 2003. I was 16 years old at the time. It was your average summer day, hanging out with friends headed towards Tower Records. Except for this day I would walk out with a life changing piece in the shape of a squeak toy.<br><br>

      A year prior I was introduced to Jhonen Vasquez’s "JTHM" and "Squee" series. My obsession was immediate. I delved further into "I Feel Sick", "Filler Bunny", and honestly later on, "Invader Zim" — special shout out to Roman Dirge as well.<br><br>

      So when I walked in and saw on the shelf "Spooky the Thing What Squeeks" — I had to have it. But something was different. It was like I knew there was something on that shelf just for me. Usually I’d browse CDs, movies, and definitely posters too. But that day, I needed to go to that shelf.<br><br>

      And I just had enough cash in my pocket for it.<br><br>

      Later that day I was in my buddy’s room as they all played games. I was stuck staring at it. Spooky. I liked that name. But even more concerning was — why did I feel like I was holding a piece of myself? This thing was… me? It reminded me of me. It was just a squeak toy from the I Feel Sick comic. But it was me?<br><br>

      "Spooky, I’m going to call myself Spooky," I thought. But I also needed a last name. I looked over to my friend’s computer desk. Back in those days video games came in these cool boxes covered in the game’s artwork. And there was a game I was equally becoming obsessed with — American McGee’s Alice. "McGee…" I recall taking a moment to reflect on it. "Spooky… McGee… I’m going to call myself Spooky McGee."

      <em>Fitting The Top Hat</em><br><br>
      By the fall, my friend would introduce me to a website for the art community at large — DeviantArt.com. For the record, DeviantArt today and DeviantArt then are two entirely different beasts. I needed a name and it was the perfect spot for SpookyMcGee to arrive.<br><br>

      My first submission and earliest drawing of the character Spooky McGee, then known as Sp1k3r 0M3GA (because I was into the movie ‘Hackers’):<br>
      <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/spookymcgee/art/First-Submission-to-DA-3018882" target="_blank">First Submission to DA</a><br><br>

      Over the next couple of years I would design the look, ideas — everything regarding Spooky. A collection of my hideous drawings can be seen here:<br>

      But it wasn’t until 2005 that I began adding this character into my writings. I’m not going to share those here because they’re too awful — but they’re out there.<br><br>

      This name, this character, began to mean something to me. He was alive. He was an idea. He was a dream. He was everything I wished I could be. But at the core of it all, he was — and is — my heart. Even at times when I rejected the name, I always went back to it.<br><br>

      As I grew up, the name became a local legend for a while. I recall being introduced to people and them freaking out: “Oh man! You’re Spooky?! I’ve heard so many stories about you! You’re a legend.” I honestly couldn’t tell you what those stories entailed — but it was a thing.<br><br>

      As I fell in love and retreated into relationships, the name faded from local lore. But I kept it. Used it for as much as I could. Over time, others have used it, created songs, wrote comics. But for me, the original goes all the way back to 2003.

      <em>Death Forever</em><br><br>
      Ravens Immortal.<br><br>
      20 years after the creation, feeling like I should give up the name, lost on life, heartbreak and regrets, I found myself sitting in a pew at church. I went in earlier than usual. Praying in my head, screaming my thoughts about heartbreak and time lost.<br><br>

      And I swear, I heard this somewhere inside — “Oh you don’t think I can't use your story… to tell a story?”<br><br>

      Next thing I knew I had visions of dark clouds, ocean waves like ink, burnt sand, a man with black eyes. Then a vision of being in the second story of a home, looking down at the alleyway below, a man with a top hat walking out. And an ending.<br><br>

      I knew then, I had to write a story and I knew who those characters would be.<br><br>

      April 2024 I would finally get the courage to sit down and write it, with only the beginning and ending in mind, I had to write this tale.<br><br>

      And in that tale I would bring Spooky McGee back to life. Not as a main character, but as a close supporting character — as Spooky has always been in my own life.<br><br>

      Now, he’s alive. Full of personality. Given a family — Star, his daughter. Nona, his wife. Both based off real close friends, and with their full permission to use them.<br><br>

      Honoring not just the character I created — now honoring the friends who helped me along the way, and who fully supported this idea since.<br><br>

      In this book, I prove just how important — and how much I love — this character.
