      <em>The Thread Begins</em><br><br>
      In the summer of 2003, I walked into a Tower Records with some friends and left with something that would change my life forever.  
      It wasn’t a book or a CD. It was the simplest thing — a squeak toy.<br><br>

      As a fan of <em>JTHM</em>, <em>I Feel Sick</em>, <em>Squee</em>, and yes, even <em>Invader Zim</em>, finding something from Jhonen Vasquez’s world was worth whatever money I had at sixteen.  
      There on a shelf, it called out to me: <strong>“Spooky the Thing What Squeeks.”</strong>  
      I felt drawn to it — beyond fandom. Like it had been waiting for me.<br><br>

      Later that day, at my friend’s house, I just stared at it. And something shifted.  
      The thing reminded me of myself — and I couldn’t explain why.  
      I felt the sudden, strange desire to call myself “Spooky.”  
      But it wasn’t complete. Like Jack Skellington… it needed a last name.<br><br>

      Then I saw it, sitting on my friend’s shelf: a game box for <em>American McGee’s Alice.</em>  
      And I knew.  
      “McGee… Spooky McGee.” That was it. That was me.<br><br>

      By that fall, I had joined DeviantArt — a completely different kind of place back then.  
      A real online art community. I needed a name.  
      It was simple: <strong>Spooky McGee.</strong>

      <em>The First Stitch</em><br><br>
      He started showing up in sketches, scribbles, and dream-journals.  
      I didn’t have a full story yet — just fragments.  
      Scenes of him standing in streets alone. Smiling through stitched lips. Watching things unravel from rooftops.<br><br>

      The tone was strange. Sometimes silly, sometimes sad. But Spooky never left.  
      Even when the stories didn’t make sense… he was always there.  
      A quiet constant in a loud, shapeless time.

  <div class="section section-3">
    <div class="text-box">
      <em>Ravens Immortal</em><br><br>
      In 2023, everything changed.  
      After years of grief, heartbreak, and creative silence, I prayed for clarity — and what came back was a vision.  
      A desert. A mirror. A stitched man in a top hat. A broken boy standing in the sand. <em>That</em> was the spark.<br><br>

      That’s how <strong>Ravens Immortal</strong> was born. And that’s when Spooky McGee stopped being a background character.  
      He became a myth, a prophet, a mentor — and a father.  
      He became my throughline.  
      The one who guides others through heartbreak because he’s sewn through his own.
